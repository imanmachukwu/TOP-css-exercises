div .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/*This code would have worked too:
.container {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

But the reason it was not used is that the last div block would have a yellow background color which means the space between the two paragraphs would be yellow too. In the outcome image, it is not so.*/
